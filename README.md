# Website

This is the source for my personal website and blog at [https://ptcrash.dev](https://ptcrash.dev). It is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the [Engimo theme by achary](https://github.com/achary/engimo), which in term is a fork of [Minimo by MunifTanjim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo).

## Usage

**Prerequisite**: you must first install Hugo, a static site generator before you can use this site locally.

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages at https://ptcrash.dev/. You can run it locally (IDK why you'd do that but aight) by cloning the repo and running the following commands:

```bash
$ hugo serve # To run a local webserver on port 1313
# Or
$ hugo -d docs # To render the HTML into the docs/ directory
```

### Draft Pages
To render draft pages, add the `-D` flag to either the `hugo server` to run the temp server and `hugo -d docs` to render to the docs/ directory.

## Contributing
PRs to correct spelling and grammar mistake are welcome. Please don't submit general changes; This is my own personal project and I like the way it looks.
