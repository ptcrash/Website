I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a frontend guy. I lack the desire to learn the latest JS frameworks and artistically speaking, I have about as much creative talent as an ironing board. So, I heavily rely on frameworks and tools to wireframe, skeleton, and otherwise fill the creative void in my projects. This is my list of tools I turn to first. I've broken them up into several categories based on the type of media you can get. To make it on my list, each website should have these attributes:
1. Free & open licensing w/ commercial use, Creative Commons, or Public Domain
2. Easily Queryable
3. Quality (subjective, I know, but it's *my* list so...)

Without further ado, my favorite tools for collecting media elements.

## Stock Images
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): It's like Instagram with lots of artsy amateur photography but its search feature is powerful and it's free to use.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/): Similar to but not as filterable as Unsplash. Tends to have more stereotypically stock looking images.
- [Nasa Image and Video Library](https://images.nasa.gov/): Lots of great historical & retro images. Good resource for images of Earth, space, and the stars. Read the [licensing](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html) - It's kinda complicated.
- [Flickr: The Commons](https://www.flickr.com/commons) - More recent images and art compared to the library collections. An uncomfortable number of naked infants (!?!)

## Art, Drawings, Maps
- [New York Public Library](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/): Old drawings, maps, and photographs. Lots of really cool historical stuff. Can search by public domain only.
- [Artvee](https://artvee.com/): Great collection of classic art, advertisements, and abstract art. According to the [ToS](https://artvee.com/terms-of-service/), it's all public domain. Kinda slow but usually worth checking
- [Smithsonian Digital Collection](https://www.si.edu/explore): Great source of artifacts, photographs, and 3d models. Advanced search is here: http://collections.si.edu/search/.
- [British Museum Collection](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection): Good source of CC licensed artifacts and art.
- [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/): All maps, all licensed under Creative Commons Noncomercial.
- [Rawpixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/category/53/public-domain): Lots of popular artists and a small selection of photographs.

## Illustrations
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/): Great vector & raster illustrations. Very reminiscent of Atlassianâ€™s illustrations [Plugin](https://xd.undraw.co/) for Adobe XD.
- [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.io/): Similar to unDraw. Some Animated illustrations, too.
- [Illustrations.co](https://illlustrations.co/): Small collection of varying styles. Not Searchable but grouped into categories. Might be useful for a bizspeak front matter page.

## Placeholders
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/): The best placeholder, in my opinion. My default choice.
- [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/): Because the internet loves cats.
- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/): The 'OG' of placeholders. Default skeleton images are quick and easy. Sometimes I use these blank placeholders over Unsplash if the content of the image for placeholding hasn't been determined. Better for some clients who would otherwise struggle to grasp the concept of placeholders.

## Icons / Fonts
- [DrawKit (again)](https://www.drawkit.io/free-icons): DrawKit has a good set of icons. They compliment their illustrations well.
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/): My go-to icon package.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Super bloated and goes against my desire to help end [website obesity](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm). But in a pinch, it will have all the icons you need to ship a frontend.

#### Source Pro Family
A beautiful FOSS font family from Adobe. Download the compiled fonts from the GitHub releases page or link them from Google Fonts.
1. [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) ([G Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro))
2. [Source Serif Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro) ([G Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro))
3. [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) ([G Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro))


## Bonus: Wireframe Kits
- [Contra UI Kit](https://contrauikit.com/): Really interesting color scheme. I haven't used it yet but I've bookmarked it for later.
- [Puzzle Wireframe Kit](https://github.com/puzzle/wireframe-kit): Wireframe Elements designed for [draw.io](https://draw.io). A neat concept; I probably won't use it until my Sketch student subscription expires.
